## Overview

LGL Keychron Helper is a Linux desktop wrapper for the official [Keychron Launcher](https://launcher.keychron.com/). It bundles the browser engine Launcher requires, provides WebHID device access, and guides users through Linux USB permissions while preserving Keychron's intended interface and connection flow.

- Uses the live Keychron Launcher rather than recreating the configurator: button mapping, macros, lighting, DPI/sensitivity, polling rate, and other device-specific controls are all handled by Launcher's own interface, not reimplemented here
- Supports devices officially recognised by Keychron Launcher
- Runs the graphical application as an ordinary user
- Automatically detects and guides the user through fixing missing Linux HID permissions
- Targets a source-built prototype followed by distribution via Fedora COPR

> [!NOTE]
> This is a working prototype: it connects to a physical Keychron device and lets Launcher read and configure it. An application icon and Fedora RPM/COPR packaging are still in progress.

## Initial Target

| Area | Target |
|---|---|
| **Operating System** | Fedora Linux |
| **Development Environment** | Fedora 44 Distrobox |
| **Runtime Environment** | Fedora host desktop |
| **Initial Device** | Keychron M7 8K |
| **Connection** | Wired USB or wireless (Keychron dongle) |
| **Web Configurator** | Keychron Launcher |

> [!NOTE]
> Development and testing focus on Fedora, since that's what the author runs, but nothing in the app or its `udev`/`pkexec` setup is Fedora-specific. It should work on any systemd + `udev` + PolicyKit-based Linux distro.

> [!CAUTION]
> Wireless (dongle) connection works for ordinary configuration, but Launcher itself displays this notice when a device is connected via the dongle: *"Please use a wired connection to upgrade your keyboard/mouse. This page is currently showing the receiver."* Use a wired connection for firmware updates.

## Architecture

The application uses:

- **Electron** for the desktop runtime, Chromium engine, WebHID integration, and security boundaries
- **TypeScript** for the main process
- Small, sandboxed local HTML/JS popups (no framework) for trusted local screens such as the About window, device-connection confirmation, and permission setup

Keychron Launcher remains isolated remote content. Local screens do not replace or inject themselves into the Launcher interface.

```text
Keychron Launcher
       |
       | navigator.hid.requestDevice()
       v
Electron WebHID permission boundary
       |
       v
User-selected, verified Keychron USB device
```

---

## Security Model

Remote Launcher content is treated as untrusted web content even though it is supplied by the supported vendor.

- Node.js integration is disabled for remote content
- Context isolation and renderer sandboxing are enabled
- Hardware access is restricted to verified Keychron devices by USB vendor ID (origin validation is not yet implemented, tracked as a known gap)
- Unrelated browser permissions are denied by default
- Navigation, popups, and external URLs are controlled (download interception is not yet implemented, tracked as a known gap)
- Trusted local content is separated from the remote website
- Native operations use narrow, typed, validated interfaces
- The remote website receives no arbitrary shell or filesystem access

Linux device access uses a narrow `udev` rule installed through a `pkexec`-invoked helper. The graphical application never runs as root.

## Current Status

- [x] Requirements gathered
- [x] Architecture selected
- [x] Security boundaries defined
- [x] Project plan written
- [x] Direct dependencies pinned and audited
- [x] Electron main process scaffold
- [x] Application menu, About window, and navigation controls
- [x] Keychron Launcher WebHID proof of concept (confirmed connecting to a physical M7 8K)
- [x] Guided Fedora device permissions (detects missing `hidraw` access and installs the `udev` rule via an in-app `pkexec` prompt)
- [x] M7 8K feature validation (button mapping, macros, lighting, DPI, polling rate, and other controls confirmed working through Launcher)
- [ ] Fedora RPM
