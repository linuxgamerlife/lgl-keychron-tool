## About

| | |
|---|---|
| **Application** | LGL Keychron Helper |
| **Version** | v0.0.1 |
| **Status** | Phase 1 — Electron shell scaffolded; Launcher loads; WebHID device recognition pending physical M7 8K testing |
| **License** | MIT |
| **Author** | [LinuxGamerLife](https://www.youtube.com/@linuxgamerlife) |

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for a detailed history of changes.

## Overview

LGL Keychron Helper is a Linux desktop wrapper for the official [Keychron Launcher](https://launcher.keychron.com/). It will bundle the browser engine Launcher requires, provide WebHID device access, and guide users through Linux USB permissions while preserving Keychron's intended interface and connection flow.

- Uses the live Keychron Launcher rather than recreating the configurator
- Supports devices officially recognised by Keychron Launcher
- Runs the graphical application as an ordinary user
- Keeps native diagnostics and permission guidance behind an Advanced section
- Targets a source-built prototype followed by a Fedora RPM

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is in the planning and initial scaffolding stage. It is not yet a working configurator.

---

## Initial Target

| Area | Target |
|---|---|
| **Operating System** | Fedora Linux |
| **Development Environment** | Fedora 44 Distrobox |
| **Runtime Environment** | Fedora host desktop |
| **Initial Device** | Keychron M7 8K |
| **Connection** | Wired USB |
| **Web Configurator** | Keychron Launcher |

---

## Planned Features

| Category | Initial Prototype Scope |
|---|---|
| **Device Connection** | Detect and connect officially supported Keychron devices through WebHID |
| **Button Mapping** | Remap mouse buttons and assign macros or actions |
| **Macros** | Create, edit, assign, and remove macros |
| **Lighting** | Configure effects, colour, brightness, saturation, and speed |
| **M7 8K Controls** | DPI/sensitivity stages, polling rate (up to 8K), lift-off distance, and other non-firmware settings |
| **Linux Permissions** | Detect missing HID access and offer guided PolicyKit setup |
| **Diagnostics** | Advanced device, permission, environment, and connection information |

Firmware updates are deliberately deferred until safe flashing, failure handling, and device recovery procedures have been designed and physically tested.

---

## Architecture

The application will use:

- **Electron** for the desktop runtime, Chromium engine, WebHID integration, and security boundaries
- **TypeScript** for application code
- **React** for trusted local screens such as device selection, diagnostics, permission guidance, and errors
- **Vite** for local renderer builds
- **Vitest** for automated testing

Keychron Launcher will remain isolated remote content. React will not replace or inject itself into the Launcher interface.

```text
Keychron Launcher
       |
       | navigator.hid.requestDevice()
       v
Electron WebHID permission boundary
       |
       v
User-selected, verified Keychron USB device
```

---

## Security Model

Remote Launcher content is treated as untrusted web content even though it is supplied by the supported vendor.

- Node.js integration is disabled for remote content
- Context isolation and renderer sandboxing are enabled
- Hardware access is restricted to approved origins and verified devices
- Unrelated browser permissions are denied by default
- Navigation, popups, downloads, and external URLs are controlled
- Trusted local React content is separated from the remote website
- Native operations use narrow, typed, validated interfaces
- The remote website receives no arbitrary shell or filesystem access

Linux device access will use a narrow `udev` rule and a minimal PolicyKit helper. The graphical application will never run as root.

---

## Development

The application is built inside Fedora 44 Distrobox and run on the host for graphical, WebHID, `udev`, PolicyKit, and physical-device testing.

Inside the development Distrobox, the host project may be available at:

```text
/run/host/development/projects/lgl-keychron-tool
```

Install the locked JavaScript dependencies with:

```bash
npm ci
```

The current prototype only builds the Electron main process (no renderer yet — that arrives in Phase 2). Build inside the Distrobox, then run on the host:

```bash
# Inside the Fedora 44 Distrobox
npm run build:main

# From a host terminal — executes the Electron binary directly, no
# npm/Node install required on the host itself
node_modules/electron/dist/electron .
```

> Do not commit `node_modules`, build output, test output, logs, or local environment files.
